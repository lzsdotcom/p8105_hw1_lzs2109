**Problem 1**

``` r
library(tidyverse)
hw1_df = tibble(
  vec_numeric = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical = vec_numeric > 0,
  vec_character = c("Sphinx", "of", "black", "quartz", "judge", "my", "vow", 
                    "is", "a", "pangram"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("good", "poor", "good", "good", "fair", "poor", "fair", 
                        "fair", "poor", "good"))
)

mean(pull(hw1_df, vec_numeric))
```

    ## [1] 0.03310737

``` r
mean(pull(hw1_df, vec_logical))
```

    ## [1] 0.4

``` r
mean(pull(hw1_df, vec_character)) #unable to take the mean of vec_character
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw1_df, vec_character)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(hw1_df, vec_factor)) #also unable to take the mean of vec_factor
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(hw1_df, vec_factor)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

The character vectors create an error when passing them through the mean
function, because a mean cannot be taken from characters. The logical
vector is able to produce a mean, because a TRUE is equal to 1 and a
FALSE is equal to 0. Passing logical vectors through the as.numeric
function produces these 1s and 0s, as shown below. However, passing
character vectors forces all entries to NAs, because no equivalent
numeric values exist for characters and words as far as R is concerned.
This explains why R is unable to take the mean of a character vector as
well, as NA has no values to take the mean of. The mean of a string of
NAs will be NA.

``` r
as.numeric(hw1_df$vec_logical)
as.numeric(hw1_df$vec_character)
as.numeric(hw1_df$vec_factor)
mean(as.numeric(hw1_df$vec_character))
```

**Problem 2**

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins") #loads in penguin dataset
```

The penguins dataset includes information about penguins! The variables
listed in the dataset include species, island, bill\_length\_mm,
bill\_depth\_mm, flipper\_length\_mm, body\_mass\_g, sex, year, for a
total of 8 rows and 344 observations, or different penguins. The word
penguin is already starting to lose meaning from repetition.
Interestingly, in this dataset, the mean flipper length in millimeters
is 200.9152047 mm. Hereâ€™s a scatterplot of flipper length vs bill
length! (both measured in millimeters)

``` r
#plot penguins data below - bill length vs flipper length, colored by species
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, 
                     color = species)) + geom_point()
```
